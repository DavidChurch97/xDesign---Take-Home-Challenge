# Tech Test

Your task is to create a React application that will consume data from the SpaceX public API. The application must retrieve historic and future SpaceX launches and present them in a list view.
Provided in this pack are a copy of the designs as well as all of the assets you will need. Use the create-react-app CLI tool to generate a new react project and feel free to use any 3rd party packages that will assist in your development.

Designs are available from: [https://sketch.cloud/s/yyv1b/agmoaZP](https://sketch.cloud/s/yyv1b/agmoaZP)

The API documentation is available from:
Postman - [https://docs.spacexdata.com](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)
GitHub - [https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

## Stories:

- As a user, I want the ability to load the full list of SpaceX launches from the SpaceX API
- As a user, I want the ability to reload the data to see any new changes
- As a user, I want the ability to filter the launch list by year
- As a user, I want the ability to sort all launches by date (ascending/descending)

## Considerations we will be looking for in your submission are:

- Project approach
- Accuracy of designs
- State management
- Code quality (e.g patterns and organisation of the application code)
- Network logic

## Bonus Considerations:

- Accessibility (A11y) best practices.
- Type Safety i.e propTypes or TypeScript
- Unit Tests

Please complete the task using a Git source control tool such as GitHub or Bitbucket. Remember to commit your code regularly. And as your submission, please provide access and the URL to the repository.

Don't worry if you can't complete everything on the list, try your best and feel free to detail what extra things you would have done if time permitted it.

## Thoughts:
I approached this project with the mind set on getting the base design completed as I knew that wouldn't of been an issue as there was a sketch layout file already provided. Once I had the design down I began working on the API part of the project, as I have never had any experience with working with APIs either in React or base JavaScript this was a new experience, so I was learning as I was developing. I managed to get my code to fetch the full list of launches requested and the details shown in the sketch file however I was unable to get the table loop design to match.

If I managed to spend more time on this I would've spent it looking at how I could set the IDs I created in the CSS to work with the JSON IDs as I was unable to style the text inside the table without it all overlapping each other. I would also spend this time completing the sort/filter as I was unable to add this feature due to spending most of my time in development learning about how to use APIs.
